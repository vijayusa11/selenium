Certainly! Based on the fields you are inserting from the Excel file into the SQL Server database, here is an example of how you can create the corresponding database table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE YourTableName (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1), -- Assuming you want an auto-incrementing primary key
    Date DATE NOT NULL,
    Agent NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    TimesheetOwner NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    TotalTalkingTime NVARCHAR(20) -- Adjust the size based on your data length
);
```

### Explanation:
- **Id**: This is an auto-incrementing primary key column, which uniquely identifies each row in the table.
- **Date**: Stores the date value from the Excel file.
- **Agent**: Stores the agent value from the Excel file.
- **TimesheetOwner**: Stores the timesheet owner value from the Excel file.
- **TotalTalkingTime**: Stores the total talking time value from the Excel file. Since you mentioned it might be in the format `00:00:00`, `NVARCHAR` is used to store it as a string.

### Considerations:
- Adjust the data types and sizes (`NVARCHAR`, `DATE`, etc.) based on the actual data characteristics and requirements of your application.
- Ensure the primary key (`Id`) is set up correctly according to your database's best practices.
- Add any additional columns or constraints as needed by your application.

### Integration with C# Code:
In your C# code, ensure the `InsertIntoDatabase` method is correctly updated to match the table structure you've defined here. Adjust column names, types, and any necessary validation or handling based on your specific requirements.
